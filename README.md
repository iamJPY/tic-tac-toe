## Create and link a JavaScript file to index.html
- [x] Create a JavaScript file inside the "js" folder and link it to index.html
- [x] If you're using jQuery, link index.html to the latest version of jQuery.

## Project Instructions
- [x] Use the supplied mockup files and HTML snippets to guide you in building a Tic Tac Toe game. You can use jQuery or plain JavaScript to complete this project. Don't use an already programmed Tic Tac Toe plugin or library.
- [x] When the page loads, the startup screen should appear. Use the tictactoe-01-start.png mockup, and the start.txt HTML snippet to guide you.
- [x] Add programming, so that when the player clicks the start button the start screen disappears, the board appears, and the game begins. Use the tictactoe-02-inprogress.png mockup, and the board.txt HTML snippet to guide you.

## Add the game play following these rules:
- [x] Play alternates between X and O.
- [x] The current player is indicated at the top of the page -- the box with the symbol O or X is highlighted for the current player.
- [x] When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the square.
- [x] Players can only click on empty squares. When the player clicks on an empty square, attach the class box-filled-1 (for O) or box-filled-2 (for X) to the square.
- [x] The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row, the game is a tie.

- [x] Add programming so that when the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears.
- [x] Show the word "Winner" or the phrase "It's a Tie!"
- [x] Add the appropriate class to the <div> for the winning screen: <div class="screen screen-win" id="finish"> screen-win-one for player 1, screen-win-two for player two, or screen-win-tie if the game ends with no winner.
- [x] Add programming so that when a player pushes the "New Game" button, the board appears again, empty, and a new game begins.
- [x] Use the module pattern to wrap all of your JavaScript code into a single global variable or an immediately invoked function.

# Extra Credit
- [x] On the start screen, prompt the user add their name before the game starts
- [x] Display the player’s name on the board screen during game play
- [x] Add programming to support playing against the computer. Only one player plays; the other is controlled by your programming.
- [x] Display the player’s name if they win the game

## Make sure your program is free of syntax errors.
- [x] You can monitor any errors by looking at the Developer Tools console in your browser.
- [x] Use jsHint (see Resources links) to check your code for syntax and formatting problems. (Installed as an Atom.io plugin)

## Commenting
- [x] Make sure you add code comments to explain how your programming works.
